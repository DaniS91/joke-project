# _Joke Generator Game_

#### By _**Tanya Prado, Dani Steely, Geoffrey Gao, Emil Anton**_

#### _This application uses an API to generate a joke, then allows the user to practice remembering a joke by guessing a word randomly removed. After entering the guess into an input box, the application compares the two versions of the joke for correctness._

## Technologies Used

* _Javascript_
* _HTML_
* _CSS_
* _ESLint_
* _Babel_
* _[JokeApi](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/)_


## Description

_First the user can click the "Generate Joke" button. This button uses [JokeApi](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/) to generate a random joke. When the user clicks the "Practice!" button, a form is created which recreates the joke with one random word replaced by an input box. The user can make a guess by entering text into the input box and clicking the "Compare" button. After the compare button is selected, the application compares the original joke to the user's guess and displays the results: either a correct message or an incorrect message._
